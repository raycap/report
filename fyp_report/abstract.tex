In robotic assembly task, the robotic arm must be able to cooperate with a lot of uncertainites in the dynamic environment. Thus, the ability to know about contact force is crucial in assembly robot.

This project seeks to develop a model to estimate the contact force of manipulator arm without force sensor, using only motor currents or torques.

The report starts from literature review from previous researches about contact force estimation, followed by mathematical models to calculate the contact force from motor torques. 

The next section will be about the necessary equipments and setup to run the experiments. Thereafter, results and model identification are presented, where verification of the results are available in the following chapter.

The last chapter touches on the conclusion and future works needed from this project.
