In robotic assembly task, the robotic arm must be able to cooperate with a lot of uncertainites in the dynamic environment. Thus, the ability to know about contact force is crucial in assembly robot.

This project seeks to develop a model to estimate and control the contact force of manipulator arm without force sensor, using only motor currents or torques.

The report starts from literature review from previous researches about contact force estimation, followed by mathematical models to calculate the contact force from motor torques. 

The next section will be about the necessary equipments and setup to run the experiments. Thereafter, results and model identification are presented, where the developed algorithm to estimate contact force is available in the following chapter. Verification of the result is also shown after the algorithm chapter. 

The next chapter talks about the force control of the robot using motor torques, where one particular small assembly task is demonstrated.

The last chapter touches on the conclusion and future works needed from this project.
